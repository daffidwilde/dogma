# Dogma

This repository is an electronic version of the DuckRabbit game, "Dogma", the
setting of which is thus:

> The year is 1610. The place: the most blessed University of Padua. We are the
> refined gentlemen of the University's Natural Philosophy Society, and each
> month we print an influential Astronomy Journal.
> 
> But all is not well. Dangerous new ideas abound, shaking the oldest
> foundations of knowledge to the core. There are secret maverick thinkers in
> our midst, who want to throw away the work of generations, and use our journal
> to espouse unproven, half-baked ideas to an uninformed public.
> 
> The worst of these mavericks, spreading his lunacy with rhetoric and lies, is
> the radical miscreant known as Galileo Galilei. He and his fellow maverick
> thinker sits with us now. We must find who they are and stop them.
> 
> All is not magnifico. Let us hope Beelzebub has a devil put aside for them.
